## Three.js Demo Project

Design & Experience Requirements
When a user first loads the space they should be in a central 'hub' space, this is a relatively small space with 3 'portals'. (Feel free to design this space and portals as you see fit - you can use content from asset packs etc).

- Before being able to explore the space, the user should see a simple modal welcoming them to the space and detailing how to control/navigate the space (WASD, joystick etc.), and any other required actions (if implemented) with some UI elements.

- When a user enters one of the portals, it should take them to a blank level (white space - no design required)

- The user should be able to exit any one of the 3 blank levels back to the central 'hub' space via a portal.
